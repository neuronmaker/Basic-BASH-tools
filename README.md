Basic BASH Tools
================

This is a collection of basic tools that I made to speed up some repetitive
tasks that I find tedious.

These files will probably "just work" independently of many configurations.
Though you may need to install external software to make some of these tools
work, but many dependencies come pre-installed with most Linux based operating
systems. Often they are ways to wrap an existing program and do something with
it without the user (me usually) needing to be physically present while the
same task is performed over and over

These may or may not work for you and your system
-------------------------------------------------

I am not maintaining a high quality set of utilities here. These are simple tools
that I made for my own personal use, on my systems, and I publish them in case
someone finds them useful.

What you need to use these
--------------------------

- Flac wrapper scripts
  - flac.sh - Requires a working flac encoder
