This is a collection of basic tools that I made to speed up some repetitive tasks I do often.

These files are intended to "just work" independantly of most configurations. You may need to install external software to make some of these tools work, 
but many dependencies come pre-installed with most Linux based operating systems. Often they are ways to wrap an existing program and do something with it without the 
user (me usually) needing to be physically present the whole time. 

Unless otherwise stated all of these files are developed to work on my local systems where I do most of my work which are usually running Linux Mint as the 
operating system and usually on X86-64 based hardware. Some minor modifications may need to be made to some of these files to work on some systems, my intent was 
never to develop a widely used application but to automate some tasks that I personally do or did do at one point or another in order to save time. If you know a 
better way to do what these tools do then please do make the modifications, I put them under the a GPL variant license for this reason.
